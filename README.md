# Attendance_Monitor_Face_Recognition
This project marks attendance of students present in the picture 
<h2> Description </h2>
<p>Facenet is used for facial recognition system (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf), the main concept behind the robustnessof facenet is is the triple loss function, where it tries to minimize the distance between positive image and target and maximize the distance between negative image and target.</p>

<h2> Experimental Setup </h2>
<p> Replace the images in the trainig and test folder with your own images</p>
<p> Download the pickle file of Facenet and place it in src folder</p>
<p> Install python3, jupyter notebooks or anaconda </p>
<p> Install sqlitedb for storing the data of class</p>

<h2> Result </h2>
